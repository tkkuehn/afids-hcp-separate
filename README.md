# AFIDs-HCP

This dataset contains imaging and AFID (anatomical fiducial) placement data for a subset (n=30) of the Human Connectome Project.

This subset consists of 30 unrelated healthy subjects (age: 21-52; 15 female and 15 male) chosen from the Human Connectome Project dataset (HCP). All scans were T1-weighted MR volumes with 1 mm voxels acquired on a 3-T scanner. 

Two independent raters annotated all the 30 subjects for a total of three AFIDs protocol applications (2,880 fiducials) via 3DSlicer 4.10.0.
